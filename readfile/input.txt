To reduce memory usage for large text files, you can process lines immediately instead of adding it to the 
list as in the previous example. To do that use File.ReadLines. This method internally creates Enumerator. 
Every time foreach asks for a next value, it calls StreamReader.Re­adLine under the hood.
